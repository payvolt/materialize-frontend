                        <p>I'm Kirill Ioannidi, father of a girl, and also an entrepreneur in my soul just like you. I understand your difficulties and your desire to develop
                            a startup because I was there too.</p>

                            <p>Nine years in uniform in the Air Force, a year in the aerospace industry and another year and a half at Siemens... But I knew I could do more, I felt that it was
                            n't right for me to work at a job from 9:00 to 17:00 and I wanted to be remembered as someone who did a little more than
                            getting through life and because I opened my first startup called: Payvolt.io which was successfully sold!</p>

                            <p>I went through ups and downs, abnormal difficulties, full of mistakes, sleepless nights, wasted money, layoffs/hiring
                            and more... But I didn't stop there, being an entrepreneur I immediately looked for new ventures to work on and that's how I ended up at Matirilize.</p>

                            <p>After talking to hundreds of entrepreneurs I noticed a pattern of behavior. Lots of entrepreneurs want to pay for unnecessary presentations and product development
                            Hundreds of thousands of shekels even before they realized if their idea was good.</p>

                            <p>My goal is to make you a shark entrepreneur!</p>

                            <p>Don't be another dairy entrepreneur who does everything for him and empty his pockets in the process, are you as an investor - would you
                            invest in such an entrepreneur?</p>

                            <p>I heard and got to know different entrepreneurs and realized that my calling is to help those entrepreneurs advance our world with the help of startups and innovation</p>
